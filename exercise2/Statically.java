This is why I had to change the 'stats.methods()' and 'stats.glue' calls to the class name 'Statically' to get them to work. A static class can return an instance in both JS and Java. The way it accesses variables is also the similar. The 'static' keyword seems to be used far less in JS than in Java. This is most likely the case because JS isn't always using OOP principles such as encapsulation/abstraction and often relies on functional programming methodologies.");
